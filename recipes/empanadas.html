            <p>This truly traditional beef empanadas receta (recipe) is from Salta, one of the Northern Provinces in Argentina. Made with ground beef, potatoes, hard-boiled eggs, and a fluffy homemade empanada pastry, these are just to die for!</p>

                <li>2 medium potatoes, peeled and cubed</li>
                <li>¼ cup salted butter</li>
                <li>2 medium onions, chopped</li>
                <li>2 stalks green onions, finely chopped</li>
                <li>1 ½ medium red bell peppers, seeded and chopped</li>
                <li>⅔ pound ground beef</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
                <li>3 large hard-boiled eggs, peeled and chopped</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><h3>Step 1</h3>Combine water and salt in a small saucepan over medium heat and warm through, stirring until salt is dissolved. Remove from heat and let cool for 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
                <li><h3>Step 2</h3>Combine sifted flour and melted margarine in the bowl of a food processor; pulse until crumbly. Add salt water gradually to the food processor and pulse until a soft dough ball forms that easily separates from the edge of the bowl. Add more water, 1 teaspoon at a time, only if needed. Press dough into a ball and wrap tightly with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</li>
                <li><h3>Step 3</h3>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Cover a baking sheet with aluminum foil and grease with vegetable oil. Set aside.</li>
                <li><h3>Step 4</h3>Bring a saucepan of water to a boil. Add cubed potatoes and cook until soft, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
                <li><h3>Step 5</h3>Meanwhile, melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onions and green onions until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add red peppers and cook for 5 more minutes. Add ground beef and stir with a wooden spoon until fully browned, about 5 minutes. Season with salt, cayenne pepper, cumin, and paprika. Remove from heat.</li>
                <li><h3>Step 6</h3>Drain potatoes and add to filling. Toss in chopped eggs and let filling cool down for a few minutes.</li>
                <li><h3>Step 7</h3>Remove pastry from the fridge and knead gently on a floured surface. Divide dough in half and roll out each piece to 1/8-inch thickness.</li>
                <li><h3>Step 8</h3>Cut out 3-inch circles with a pastry cutter or sharp knife and wet the edges lightly with water. Add 1 large tablespoon of filling in the center of each disc. Fold pastry over, press edges together, and seal with a fork. Transfer empanadas to the prepared baking sheet.</li>
                <li><h3>Step 9</h3>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool just a little before serving.</li>
