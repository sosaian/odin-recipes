            <p>Pastel de papas (in English Potato Pie) is like a spicy version of shepherd's pie with the addition of Chilean cheese. It's hearty and comforting.</p>
            
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>5 cups potatoes, peeled and cubed</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons butter, or to taste</li>
                <li>salt to taste</li>
                <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
                <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
                <li>1 medium onion, diced</li>
                <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
                <li>2 medium tomatoes, diced</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
                <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons shredded Panquehue cheese</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
                <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper (Optional)</li>
                <li>salt and black pepper to taste</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes.</li>
                <li>While the potatoes are cooking, heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until translucent, about 5 minutes, adding garlic for the last minute. Stir in diced tomatoes and tomato paste; cook until tomatoes soften and begin to lose their shape, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add ground beef to the skillet; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, about 10 minutes. Stir in Panquehue cheese, parsley, and cayenne pepper; season with salt and pepper. Turn off the heat and let sit until needed.</li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 2-quart baking dish.</li>
                <li>Drain potatoes in a colander, then allow to steam dry for 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer potatoes back to the pot, add butter and salt, and mash until smooth. Let cool until just warm, 5 to 10 minutes, then stir in beaten egg.</li>
                <li>Spread 1/2 of the mashed potatoes over the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Layer ground beef mixture over top, then completely cover with remaining potatoes.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until potatoes are hot and lightly browned on top, about 40 minutes.</li>
            </ol>
